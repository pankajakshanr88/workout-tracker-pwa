# Future Development Roadmap

**Project:** Intelligent Workout Tracker PWA  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 MVP Complete ‚úÖ  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

---

## üéØ Vision & Goals

Build an intelligent workout tracking app that focuses users on what actually matters for getting jacked:
1. **Progressive Overload** (automatically suggest weight increases)
2. **Training to Failure** (1 RIR validation)
3. **Smart Interventions** (detect stagnation, suggest solutions)

**Unlike existing apps (Hevy, Strong):** This app is proactive, not passive.

---

## üìã Development Phases

- `src/components/charts/ProgressChart.tsx`
- Route: `/progress/:exerciseId`

**Estimated:** 2-3 days

---

#### 2. Stagnation Detection ‚≠êÔ∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Why:** Proactively identify when users aren't progressing

**Algorithm (from spec lines 1163-1209):**
```typescript
// Trigger: Same weight for 3+ consecutive workouts
// Data: Get last 5 workouts for exercise
// Check: All weights identical?
// Action: Create alert with interventions
```

**Tasks:**

#### 3. Sandbagging Detection ‚≠êÔ∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why:** Detect when users aren't training hard enough

**Algorithm (from spec lines 1214-1268):**
```typescript
// Trigger: Same reps across 3+ sets for 2+ workouts
// Example: 10, 10, 10 reps for multiple workouts
// This indicates not training to 1 RIR
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `src/services/alerts/sandbaggingDetector.ts`
- [ ] Check for flat rep patterns (max - min ‚â§ 1)
- [ ] Create warning alert

## üîÑ Phase 3: Exercise Variations

**Goal:** Support multiple variations of each movement  
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### Why This Phase?
From spec research:
- Users need variety to break plateaus
- Different variations target different weaknesses
- Tracking variations separately provides better data

### Research-Backed Approach

**Key Insight:** Start small, use data-driven ratios

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Hardcode 40+ variations with fixed ratios
- ‚ùå Try to track everything at once
- ‚ùå Force users to learn variations

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Add 10-15 most popular variations
- ‚úÖ Learn ratios from user data over time
- ‚úÖ Make variations optional (progressive disclosure)
- ‚úÖ Suggest variations only when needed (stagnation)

### Features to Build

#### 1. Variation Database Setup
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add 10-15 common variations to seed data:
  - Front Squat (85% of back squat typical)

  - Dumbbell variations (65% per dumbbell typical)
- [ ] Set `parent_exercise_id` relationships
- [ ] Add variation descriptions

**Estimated:** 1 day

---

#### 2. Variation Selection Screen
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `VariationsScreen.tsx`

- [ ] Display last performance for each
- [ ] Let user select which to perform today

**Files to create:**
- `src/screens/VariationsScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/exercise/VariationSelector.tsx`

**Estimated:** 2 days

---

#### 3. Smart Variation Weight Suggestions
**Algorithm (improved from spec):**
```typescript
// Check user's own history first (personalized)
if (userHasDataForBothVariations) {
  return userPersonalRatio;
}

// Fall back to population average
if (enoughUsersHaveData) {
  return populationAverageRatio;
}

// Conservative default (80%)
return 0.80 * currentWeight;
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `src/services/variations/variationManager.ts`

## üìù Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. PWA vs React Native**
- **Decision:** PWA first
- **Rationale:** Faster dev, no app store friction
- **Trade-off:** Less native feel, no HealthKit

**2. sql.js vs Direct IndexedDB**
- **Decision:** sql.js with IndexedDB persistence
- **Rationale:** Familiar SQL, easier complex queries
- **Trade-off:** Larger bundle size

**3. Variations: Simplified Approach**
- **Decision:** Start with 10-15 variations, data-driven ratios
- **Rationale:** Research showed 40+ hardcoded ratios is over-engineering
- **Trade-off:** Less complete initially, but more accurate long-term

**4. Charts: Chart.js vs Recharts**
- **Decision:** Chart.js (pending Phase 2)
- **Rationale:** Lighter, faster, more mature
- **Trade-off:** Less React-friendly than Recharts
